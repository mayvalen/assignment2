        <h3>I know fashion is a huge part of you are, and so are 
            the muppets, so I asked you to style 3-4 different outfits 
            based on your favorite outfits. Can you wear them and explain

            <b>Miss Piggy</b>
            <p>I think this is the most obvious of my outfits that 
                I will show today. This jacket is very diva—not that 
                I really use that word that often—but that’s how people 
                describe Miss Piggy. She works at Vogue in Paris. She’s 
                a very stereotypical fashion woman- not at all streetwear. 
                Shes known for her volatile diva personality and use of 
                karate. She was actually a drag queen when she was created. 
                Jim Henson was a very inclusive. In the first season of sesame 
                street I dont remember his name but they had a specialist 
                who worked on diversity so kids would be exposed to different 
                types of people. Isn’t that fun? </p>

            <b>Kermit the Frog</b>
            <p>This is a very weird interpretation of kermit the frog. Very weird. Not expected. The reason he is this fun and spunky and retro - in a documentary about jim henson that came out after he died in 1997, they were describing what makes kermit so awesome. This is a very groovy little outfit. Kermit came about in the 70s and he was just a spunky guy. My favorite quote from someone was that kermit was always loved because he was a frog about town, and I was like a frog about town is just such an awesome thing to say. So this is my interpretation of a frog about time. I got really into frogs, theres like frogs all over my wall. </p>

            <b>Dr. Teeth</b>
            <p>This next one is a little chaotic. And it’s obscure. It’s not what you would expect. This is my Dr. Teeth from Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem. I don’t have a gold tooth but you can photoshop a gold tooth onto me. He’s basically like a 70s ish rocker. Like a mix of Elton John and Led Zeppelin. So this is my look, it’s just a lot of clashing patterns. Imagine me with a guitar and a piano. </p>

            <b>Animal</b>
            <p>This one is animal. But its a very refined, sexy, animal because I dont have real animal stuff. Its just this orange dress and black boots. Animal is crazy, that’s like his whole thing. In 2014 he’s at a rehab center and drum is his trigger word and jack black is his sponsor, which is awesome. Yeah he just really likes to drum, that’s his character. </p>
