            <b> Talk to me about Space Age Design. </b><br><br>

           Okay, I actually have a lot to say about this. Space Age design is so important to me. It’s sexy, we all know. Like the Jetsons look is awesome. Ive been researcing alot about retro futurism which is what they thought the future would look like in the 60s when space age was really coming about. When we think about the future today in movies and stuff its always dystopian. Back then, when you would talk about the future it was like this really awesome space age world where we fly around in little pods and households were still happy and there was no war or some horrible crisis in teen novel stuff. It was just like a cooler world. I think space age design represents a hope for the future that we’ve completely lost. Because we are trying to make so many changes for the future but the ways that we think about the future reflect the exact opposite. How are we going to make progress about the future if everytime we think about it its like a sad wasteland.

           <b>I remember talking to you a while ago about how - i guess we were talking about marvel and other universes and just how it sucks that we can’t live in that universe. Can you speak on this? </b>  <br><br>
            
           I do feel that way. It’s such an unreasonable thing to be frustrated about-that I can’t like exist in the Marvel Cinematic universe. It’s the vibe of when you go to a movie theater and watch a marvel movie or something as thrilling—and then you leave and you’re like “Well now what, I’m so hyped up and i dont have anything to do.” You just wanna like go fight crime or something but you just have to go home and go to bed. There’s no way to remedy this—I cant just start existing—it’s also like I just want to meet Tony Stark so bad. I want to impress him. But I don’t want to break up him and Pepper. I would never. But he’s dead. But not in my heart.  <br><br>

           <p><b>Do you think Space Age design is influenced by other periods of design? </b>  <br><br>
             
           Yes. It started in mid-century modern, and then as memphis milano came about with Ettore Sottsass and few other industrial designers. Memphis Milano is a very sexy sort of 80s aesthetic. But its much better and not trashy. They kind of converged because Memphis is so much more colorful just like space age is. It’s like the mod look but I guess nicher because I dont know how many people actually or how many houses that actually had design like that. I feel like it was probably more accessible than it was today but not that many people had that much money. But I really don’t know.  <br><br><br>

           <b>Do characteristics of space age design carry into design today? </b>  <br><br>
            
           Yes, totally. Gustaf Westman and those kinds of Swedish designers today have a new 2020 type of futurism coming about which is really awesome. I think it’s exciting to see us go back—it’s totally very space agey but I don’t think people know its space agey other than designers and people who care so its not representing the same metaphor that I want it to but it is very much like a 2020 space age design thats coming in and i do appreciate it.  <br><br>
            
           <b> I feel like space age design is obviously present in futuristic movies, do you have any favorite movies with that kind of aesthetic? </b><br><br>
            
           The Jetsons were the first ones to really do it. This is a weird one, but the Scooby Doo movie, the live action one, their hideout place is very space age. It’s not even because they are in the future its just because they are cool and high tech. Scooby Doo’s whole thing is that they are high tech - Velma is so high tech - and that is just a representation of the future - what we once thought it would be.
