           <b> Okay, last section. Your ambition. Simple. Kind of complex. 
            Kind of philosophical. What is your outlook on life? </b><br><br>

            I think I have a very positive outlook on life. Ive had a 
            very privileged and fortunate life - ive never felt that im 
            in a situation that I cant - like obviously there are times 
            that im not in control like i cant just not go to school if 
            i dont want to. Ive never had a family member close to me die 
            like that is something that you just have to like deal with and 
            theres nothing you can do about it. Im very rarely in situations 
            where ive been completely out of control, like theres always 
            something that you can do. I think about that a lot. I think me 
            acknowledging that has become a big thing. Because when i do feel 
            so overwhelmed im like theres always something I can do about it. 
            I don’t believe in fate. I believe if i want something then i have 
            to work for it. That keeps me going because as long as im working 
            for something, ill get it. At some point ill get there. <br><br> </p>

          <p><b>Where do you find motivation or inspiration?</b>  <br><br>
            
            I guess like my family. Im a very confident person and my family 
            sees me as someone who is going to rule the world someday. And 
            then them telling me that and me being as confident as I am keeps 
            me going <br><br>
            
           <b>Do you live by any mantras?</b>  <br><br>
             
            I think subconsciously kind of. My mantra is just dont freak out. 
            Have a positive attitude. It will be okay. The situation you are 
            in will be okay. <br><br><br>

           <b>Last question. Have you had any a ha moments since you’ve been in new 
            york.? Any major like oh shit life change?</b>  <br><br>
            
            Kind of. I guess with facetime its so easy to just be like “hey mom 
            whats up” but yes I think when my main friend group from school, we 
            were on zoom and they were all in dorms and dining halls and I was 
            like in my apartment and I just felt like such an adult. And as we’ve 
            started growing apart and all find our own ways, we still talk all the 
            time but the whole group is a lot of people so we cant talk all the 
            time but the way were all growing apart is like wow time is going by 
            and we are all becoming our own people like we are not a friend group 
            anymore we are all individual people. <br><br>
            
           <b> Its also strange how high school grouped people together versus now.</b><br><br>
            
            Its so strange. I love my group from home because we are all so different. 
            Like cyberchase. That’s how we describe ourselves. That math show. 
            Because its such a random diverse group of people and we have such 
            different interests. I hope we stay together but its cool that everybody 
            is going for what they want in the moment. But that was like my a ha moment 
            of wow, we are all grown up.
