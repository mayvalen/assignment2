           <b> Okay moving on to dance party music. Can you describe your taste in music?  </b><br><br>

           I really do not listen to sad music. Everything i listen to is extremely upbeat. I don’t like being sad, I feel like its just against my nature. Im rarely actually sad. ITs like i dont care where my music is from. Ive grown up on so many different types of music because of bollywood. I think my love for upbeat music comes from bollywood music. Its just so dancey and im a very dancey music. I just like anything thats not sad. <br><br>

           <b>Top 3 favoirite songs ?</b>  <br><br>
            
           Body but the Pitbull one. Oh my gosh, what a question. Theres too many good songs out there. Thats a problem. You know, this one’s random, but I really like bust a move. Its my moms favorite dance party song. Ill play it and then shell come out on the dance floor and do her little thang.  <br><br>
            
           <b>Do you and your parents have similar music tastes?</b>  <br><br>
             
           Yes. Very much so. Especially my dad. My dad is very just only dancey music like Bollywood and EDM basically and occasionally when we are on the beach he will listen to southern rock vibe but the only other schill music he listens to is like bollywood or famous songs.  <br><br><br>
            
           <b>Like itunes top 100?</b>  <br><br>
            
           Yeah and he really likes Attention by Charlie Puth. My mom growing up was much more assimilated to american culture. She likes rock, 80s rock is very her vibe. But my dad did not listen to much american music. But I got a little bit from both of them, we can vibe when we need to.  <br><br>
            
           <b> Do you go through phases of genres?</b><br><br>
            
           Kind of. I have the same tops usually, im trying to think. There will be parts of life that im more into bollywood that other days. It varies on days not phases.
